Milestone - I

In the skeleton you will find these files:
• index.html
• style.css
• script.js

You don't have to edit index.html and style.css

You have to work with the script.js file. In the beginnig of the file, you will see a response format simliar to the following:

var response = 
{ 
  "DOTS":   [
                ["B", 5, 6] , ["G", 23, 12] ,  ["R", 34, 7] .... 
            ] , 
 "PLAYERS": [ 
                ["P1", 8, 0, 0] , ["P2", 5, 44, 0] , 
                ["P3", -6, 0, 44] , ["P4", 10, 44, 44]
            ] 
};

This response is in JSON format. Canvas drawing is already done. This response is hard coded in client side.
